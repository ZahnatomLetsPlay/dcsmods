I make whatever I want to make which is mostly stuff that I can find enough details on (specifically dimensions for 3d modeling). I'm not good at texturing and especially bad at shading so excuse the visual quality.
The performance may not be entirely accurate to IRL but thats often due to limitations with the DCS engine and ofc a lack of details.
